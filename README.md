Everyone has to understand Software development lifecycle irrespective of background either a developer, tester or Devops. 
Below i would be documenting my understanding on what SDLC is all about and the stages.

## SDLC: Software Development Life cycle
This is a standard that is followed in the software industry, listed below are software development lifecycle stages:
-Planning stage
- Design stage
- Build stage
- Test stage
- Deployment stage

The end goal is to deliver high quality product

### Planning stage
This is the initial stage after you get a feed back, it involves gathering of information.

### Desgin stage
This stage is devided into high level design and low level design.
High level design design involves the scalability in time of high demands. While low level design is the function or modules to be used 
in terms of the programming language, data base and so on.

Note: The build stage, test stage and deployment stage are the top 3 important stages for DevOps and also the pillar of software development cycle.

### Build stage
This involves development. This is the point where developers starts writing the code, this codes are then pushed to a source code repo.

### Test stage
This is the phase where the QE test the application code from the source code repo.

### Deployment phase
This is the pahse of pushing to the production server which is received by the customers.

Devops come in to improve organisation efficiency by delivering the code quickly and also ensuring that building, testing and deployment 
is not done manually but automated.
